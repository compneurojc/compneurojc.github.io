    <h2>Overview</h2>

  <h4><b>Mission Statement</b></h4>
  <p>This journal club aims to provide a forum for discussing neurons, brains, and behavior among people with diverse quantitative and neurobiology backgrounds. Weekly meetings will focus on a paper relevant to a theoretical understanding of some
    neuroscientific problem or system. Graduate students and postdocs are especially encouraged to attend and propose/present papers. Appropriate papers present neural data, theoretical models, foundational principles for computation, new
    statistical, mathematical, or machine learning methods, etc.</p>
